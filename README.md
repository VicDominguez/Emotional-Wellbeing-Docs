    <p>Final Masters Project to design and implement an application to detect stress, depression, loneliness and suicide risk, giving custom advices to users.</p>

This repo contains the documents (book and presentation) of my Master's Thesis on 
[Distributed and Embedded Systems Software](https://www.upm.es/internacional/Students/StudiesDegrees/UniversityMasters/Master%20programs?id=61.3&fmt=detail), *Emotional Wellbeing*, done on July 2024.

Numerous studies have established correlations between certain mental health disorders (such as stress, depression or loneliness); with variables such as heart rate variability, sleep habits or physical activity, and advances in hardware enabled measurement of these variables non-invasively using wearable devices.

With this context, this Master’s Thesis aims to design and implement an application for Android devices (it can be found [here](https://github.com/Emotional-Wellbeing/App)) to detect stress, depression, loneliness and suicide risk through questionnaires and extracting data from wearable devices. 

Depending on the user’s state, the application will offer advices to improve their emotional wellbeing, along with anonymised statistics on the emotional wellbeing status in the university community, which will be computed by a server component (can be found [here](https://github.com/Emotional-Wellbeing/API)).

Moreover, this system has been designed to be used as part of future research, or extended by other students in their final projects; paying special attention to key topics, such as accessibility, adaptive design or internationalisation, among others.
