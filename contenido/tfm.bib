abstract = {An intrinsic part of being human is the ability to create. The development of human civilizations has enhanced human creativity with new forms of artistic expression and revolutionary trends; while it has become a crucial element to understand the society of the moment. One of the most prominent artistic movements in history was pictorial Impressionism, using light and color in order to capture the fleetingness and uncertainty of the moment, the continuous and the indefinite in their paintings. Furthermore, there has been an explosion of knowledge and technological advances during 20th century. Life expectancy increased by 40 years (in Spain) since 1920, transgressive elements such as television and computer appeared on our lives, inventions like cinema, telephone and automovile were massively popularized... transforming completely our society and lifestyle. One of these advances, the computer, has become even more important in the 21st century. The incredible advances in computing power, devices, communications... facilitated that Internet and computers became an intrinsic part of our lives. In this context, Artificial Intelligence takes more and more prominence nowadays. For the first time in human history, we have been able to create machines that make decisions for themselves and with a real and profound impact on our lives. Therefore we could ask ourselves the following question: can machines create something so human as Art? This Final Degree Project aims to bring the reader closer to Artificial Intelligence through an artistic perspective. For this objective, the paintings of three great impressionist and post-impressionist artists have been taken, such as Claude Monet, Vincent Van Gogh and Paul C{\'{e}}zanne; aiming to develop a system based on Neural Networks that transforms photographs into pictures that the reader himself can use on his computer. Finally, the author hopes to make the reader aware about the advances produced in the field in a nicely and accessible way. Also, this document aims of acquiring a critical sense about the Artificial Intelligence systems that the reader uses in his everyday life due to the ethical, moral and social issues that these systems raise in our society.},
